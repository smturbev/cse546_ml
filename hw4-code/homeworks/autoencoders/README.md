## Unsupervised Learning with Autoencoders
In this problem you will implement two different autoencoders, show their predictions and evaluate them on test set.
Lastly (in pdf) you will compare autoencoder performance with PCA.

You can implement functions within `main.py` in any order, except for `main` function which should be implemented last.
There are no tests provided for this problem, as you will be training PyTorch models, and them using them for evaluation and plotting.
Complexity of these tasks (in terms of number of possible implementations) makes us unable to provide unit tests.

However, you can check if your code runs/performs reasonably with smaller number of epochs (for example epochs=3 passed into train function).

As always, after finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/autoencoders/main.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plots that you have generated.
