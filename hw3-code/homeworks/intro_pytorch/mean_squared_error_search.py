        dataloader (DataLoader): Dataloader for MSE.
            Each example is a tuple consiting of (observation, target).
            Observation is a 2-d vector of floats.
            Target is also a 2-d vector of floats, but specifically with one being 1.0, while other is 0.0.
            Index of 1.0 in target corresponds to the true class.

        float: Vanilla python float resprenting accuracy of the model on given dataset/dataloader.
            In range [0, 1].

        - For a single-element tensor you can use .item() to cast it to a float.
        - This is similar to CrossEntropy accuracy_score function,
            but there will be differences due to slightly different targets in dataloaders.

        - Network with one hidden layer of size 2 and sigmoid activation function after the hidden layer
        - Network with one hidden layer of size 2 and ReLU activation function after the hidden layer

        3. Choose and report the best model configuration based on validation losses.
