) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Main subroutine of the CrossEntropy problem.
    It's goal is to perform a search over hyperparameters, and return a dictionary containing training history of models, as well as models themselves.

    Models to check (please try them in this order):
        - Linear Regression Model
        - Network with one hidden layer of size 2 and sigmoid activation function after the hidden layer
        - Network with one hidden layer of size 2 and ReLU activation function after the hidden layer
        - Network with two hidden layers (each with size 2)
            and Sigmoid, ReLU activation function after corresponding hidden layers
        - Network with two hidden layers (each with size 2)
            and ReLU, Sigmoid activation function after corresponding hidden layers
    NOTE: Each model should end with a Softmax layer due to CrossEntropyLossLayer requirement.

    Args:
        dataloader_train (DataLoader): Dataloader for training dataset.
        dataloader_val (DataLoader): Dataloader for validation dataset.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Dictionary/Map containing history of training of all models.
            You are free to employ any structure of this dictionary, but we suggest the following:
            {
                name_of_model: {
                    "train": Per epoch losses of model on train set,
                    "val": Per epoch losses of model on validation set,

def accuracy_score(model, dataloader) -> float:
    """Calculates accuracy of model on dataloader. Returns it as a fraction.

    Args:
        model (nn.Module): Model to evaluate.
        dataloader (DataLoader): Dataloader for CrossEntropy.
            Each example is a tuple consiting of (observation, target).
            Observation is a 2-d vector of floats.
            Target is an integer representing a correct class to a corresponding observation.

    Returns:
        float: Vanilla python float resprenting accuracy of the model on given dataset/dataloader.
            In range [0, 1].

    Note:
        - For a single-element tensor you can use .item() to cast it to a float.
        - This is similar to MSE accuracy_score function,
            but there will be differences due to slightly different targets in dataloaders.

        2. Plot Train and Validation losses for each model all on single plot (it should be 10 lines total).
            x-axis should be epochs, y-axis should me Crossentropy loss, REMEMBER to add legend
        3. Choose and report the best model configuration based on validation losses.
            In particular you should choose a model that achieved the lowest validation loss at ANY point during the training.
        4. Plot best model guesses on test set (using plot_model_guesses function from train file)
        5. Report accuracy of the model on test set.

    Starter code loads dataset, converts it into PyTorch Datasets, and those into DataLoaders.
